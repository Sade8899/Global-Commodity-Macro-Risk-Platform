# Global-Commodity-Macro-Risk-Platform
Global Commodity & Macro-Risk Platform

Project Overview

This is a full-stack platform designed to analyze the impact of macroeconomic and policy events on global commodity prices. It tracks time-series data for key soft commodities (like wheat, coffee, and sugar) to model price volatility and identify correlations with real-world events, such as supply chain disruptions, tariffs, or geopolitical conflict.

This project is being built to apply data science principles to real-world financial and economic analysis.

Key Features (In Development)

Data Ingestion: Python backend script to fetch and clean real-time and historical price data for a basket of global food commodities.

Time-Series Analysis: Analytical engine using Pandas to model correlations between commodity price volatility and major policy/geopolitical events.

Interactive Visualization: A dynamic web dashboard (HTML/CSS/JS) to present time-series charts and risk-impact relationships.

Technology Stack

Backend: Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Database: PostgreSQL (for storing time-series data)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Current Status

This project is actively in development.

Current Focus: Building the Python backend for data ingestion and establishing the database schema in PostgreSQL.

Next Steps: Develop the analytical functions for correlation modeling and build the API endpoints to serve data to the frontend dashboard.
